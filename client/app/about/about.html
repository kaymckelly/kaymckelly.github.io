          I'm Kay McKelly, a recent grad from Galvanize Seattle's six month web development coding bootcamp. I'm enthusiastic about user experience design, accessibility, learning new languages, and building cool stuff. My background is in sociology and birth work. I taught as a university teaching associate for three years, was a teaching assistant for three years, and have worked as a doula since 2014. I started my journey to becoming a software developer in 2015, though had been interested in tech from a young age. I grew up in Silicon Valley and have been building websites since the early 2000s.

        <p class="bodyText">
          I'm most comfortable building apps in Angular 1, using UI-Bootstrap since Angular doesn't play nice with Bootstrap. I have also used React Native to build a mobile app for iOS. I've also built small-scale apps in Java and Python. My backend stuff is typically done in Node (with and without Express), as well as some experience with Rails and C#. For database management, I've mostly used PostgreSQL (with and without Knex). I've also had some experience with Mongo.
