      GeeksCat: Thoughts From a Woman Web Dev
    </h1>
    <p>
      Oh look, a test site! Don't expect anything too elaborate for a bit. Between job applications, teaching myself Java _and_ Python, working on various side projects, and redesigning someone else's website, I'm likely to have little time for this little slice of the interwebs. I'll make an effort to have something interesting here soon though, so you can be impressed by my Mad Skillz&#8482;.
