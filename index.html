          <p class="text-justify">
              Hi, I'm Kay and I'm a full-stack developer in Seattle. I've worked with a wide vaiety of technologies including the NEAP stack (Node, Express, Angular, PostgreSQL), .NET framework (specifically ASP.NET Core 2.0), HTML/CSS/jQuery, and Python (with and without the Django framework). I've worked with a pretty wide variety of technologies and feel confident learning new ones.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
              My interests include accessibility, mobile-first development, user interface design, security, and privacy. I've also been teaching myself Java and would love to do more with it. For now, I'm most familiar with JavaScript, C#, and Python.

            I've been a bonafide geek since 1998, when I started building websites on Geocities, later editing CSS for my Livejournal layouts and writing my class notes in HTML. Growing up in Silicon Valley, with a father who worked in tech, likely influenced this. I was also fascinated by the communication possibilities and security pitfalls that came with the advent of an Internet-connected world.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
              When I went to college, I didn't yet realize how well suited I was for a career in tech. After spending my first year as a pre-med major, I switched to sociology. In this, I excelled. I maintained a high GPA in all sociology classes and was encouraged to go on to graduate school. I applied for and attended a PhD program in sociology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
              What had not been clear to me when I started college was becoming clearer by the day: I wanted to spend the majority of my time actively building things and solving problems, not theorizing. I loved teaching while in graduate school, but that was not enough to keep me there. I earned my master's degree, writing a 60 page thesis (it's available <a href="https://scholarworks.umass.edu/masters_theses_2/103/">here</a> if you'd like to read it). During my time at UMass I also co-published a piece on intersectionality in sociological journals (see <a href="http://www.socwomen.org/wp-content/uploads/swsfactsheet_intersectionality.pdf">here</a>).
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
              After leaving graduate school, I trained a home-birth midwife with the Massachusetts Midwives Alliance. I also worked with the Prison Birth Project (now sadly defunct) to provide doula services to pregnant parents who are incarcerated. I quickly realized that, for me, midwifery is best suited for volunteer work rather than a full-time career. My long-term goal is to volunteer as a pro-bono midwife and doula to families who would not otherwise be able to access such services due to lack of funds.
          </p>

            In 2015 I started teaching myself jQuery. Before committing to potentially moving across the country, I wanted to make sure that software development was where I really belonged. Seven months later, I moved across the country to start at Galvanize Seattle and have never looked back. Galvanize's curriculum included:

            After graduating from Galvanize's 6 month software development program in July 2016, I've been working as a freelance web developer for the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR) and Farcaster Consulting Group. IACR initially hired me to create a reusable website template for scientific conferences. In the process of building that, I noticed that their process for putting together a conference schedule was unwieldy; I pitched an idea for a conference program creator tool. Check out my <a href="./projects">projects</a> page for more on these and other things I've built.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
              When I'm not freelancing, I'm attending a variety of tech meetups and guest-speaking or teaching workshops. Last April, I volunteered to teach an <a href="https://www.meetup.com/She-Codes-Now-Seattle/events/237154203/">Introduction to Angular class</a> with <a href="https://www.meetup.com/She-Codes-Now-Seattle/">She Codes Now</a>. I'd like to do more of this in the future.
