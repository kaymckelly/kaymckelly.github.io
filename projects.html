            This is a visual showcase of my favorite projects. Whether it's design or topic (or, more often, both), I really enjoyed building these projects. I strongly believe that you should love what you do, so when I take on a project, it's going to be something I enjoy. There's always more work to do, so this page may not reflect updates to these apps. Please see <a href="https://github.com/kaymckelly">Github</a> for the code and latest refactoring.

            I do my best to adhere to web accessibility standards as set forth by <a href="https://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a>. This particularly affects color contrast, in order to make apps accessibile to users with impaired vision. Gray-on-gray low-contrast text is in fashion right now and while aesthetically I agree it looks nice, I'm more invested in making apps and websites that are truly accessible for all users.

            The <a href="http://iacr.org/">International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR)</a> requested a conference website redesign. IACR was primarily interested in making their conference site mobile-accessible, easily maintainable, and have a more modern look. They wanted a site they could re-use for other conferences they host, so that all the conference pages would have a standardized look. Their last conference site (shown above at left) resembled sites built in the late 1990s/early 2000s and was not mobile accessible. Additionally, the site was almost exclusively written using HTML 1.0, which debuted in 1991.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            My redesign (shown at right) is more colorful, with responsive menus and a mobile friendly design using Bootstrap 3.3. I created the <a href="http://www.colourlovers.com/palette/4331737/Cryptography_Brights">color palette</a> for the site based on IACR's logo, with bright saturated shades of orange and green that complement the deep indigo of their logo. This project is still in progress, but there is a live preview available <a href="http://geekscat.com/iacr/">here</a>.

            The six months I spent at Galvanize, an intensive coding course, culminated in a Capstone project. We were given two weeks to complete a full stack app, from concept to wireframes to building a server to designing the client side. I created an app called Boost, which centers on compassion and self-care. The screenshots above are the app as it appeared at the end of the two weeks. I created the <a href="http://www.colourlovers.com/palette/4279288/Optimism">color palette</a> exclusively for this project.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            I wanted to make this app because compassion isn't a skill that's taught in schools; it's something we have to learn ourselves as we grow up. Historically, the internet has always had issues with abuse, trolling, doxxing, cyberbullying, and a general lack of compassion. I have been fortunate to have largely avoided online abuse, but it's an issue that hits close to home as I have watched friends endure it. Boost connects you with strangers, whose stories may be similar to your own, and encourages you to show your compassion for the struggles of others.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            The main functionality of Boost is to be able to "boost" others. After logging in (see second image), users see the third image. An "ask", or a user's story, appears and your options are to "boost" them (similar to a Facebook like) or comment. If you feel like you can't help, the "boost somebody else" button will simply show you another user's story. Additional features include a meditation timer (see fourth image), an inspirational quote generator, and a self-care checklist. While all of these were important to me, it was also impossible to build all of them out thoroughly by myself within the two week period. I learned that prioritization of features and estimating how long a project will take are two of the greatest assets to web developers.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            Building a full stack app by yourself is no small undertaking. We were allowed to bounce ideas off classmates and ask questions of the instructors, but all of my classmates were working on their own apps, so I hesitated to use them as resources too often lest their own work suffer. As a result, the app was not finished at the end of the two weeks. I ran into significant setbacks in trying to implement oAuth 2.0 with Instagram login. My initial goal was to use Facebook login, but that presented even more challenges that the instructors advised me I did not have sufficient time to address.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            I also encountered the challenge of feature creep. Being enthusiastic about Boost, I kept finding new features I wanted to add. In building Boost, I learned what feature and scope creep look like, and how to stop them from happening in future projects.
